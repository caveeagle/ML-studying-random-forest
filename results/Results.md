## Results


### 1. Results with the dataset **v3**

The Random Forest model was trained on the dataset `fitted_dataset_v3.csv`

For the model accuracy metric, I used the **R2** criterion (coefficient of determination).

The tuned model parameters are:
`n_estimators=300`
`max_depth=None`
`min_samples_leaf=2`

The mean accuracy metrics are:
RMSE: 176946 Euro 
MAE: 79775 
R2: **0.683**
